                <p>Plans are our favorite delusion, only edged out by crushes. Blueprints for how the universe should behave (Rhonda bryne pops up)...<em>only if it weren’t so busy laughing</em>. Plans exist primarily to give structure to chaos (maybe it’s indeed a ladder).. The moment you declare a plan out loud, the universe marks it for destruction.</p>
                <p>Friends make vacation plans they’ll cancel via text, governments make climate plans they’ll forget faster than us relapsing to old habits. Meanwhile, productivity apps grow fat feeding on our broken dreams and weekly goals. <br> The potential was off the charts. The execution? Yeah, not so much. And yet we persist, building sandcastles out of bullet points and acting surprised when the tide of reality wipes them out.</p>
                <p class="blockquote">Maybe next time I make a plan, I’ll just add a footnote “Subject to chaos.”</p>
                <p>Plans: because lying to ourselves feels so organized.</p>
                <p class="blockquote">“Invest in preparedness; not in prediction.” said Nassim Nicholas Taleb</p>
                <p>We don't try to predict the future, we brace for the impact. Like, how many times that we have planned a thing only for it to be hit in the head by an unexplainable event. This kind of event is what Taleb calls a ‘Black Swan' and yes, he wrote a book on it. Black Swan events always happen and yet, we have this talent for retroactively <em>pretending</em> they made sense all along. Like, 'Oh yeah, of course that tariffs ruined my vacation plans.'<em> Totally predictable.</em></p>
                <p>Then why do so many of us still pretend like everything was planned out. There were things that were clearly not expected or imagined which happened and yet that was what made life <em>interesting</em>. Knowing everything you want is delusional to a fault. It simply can't be.</p>
                <p>P.S. This felt off, I would like to revise it in the future. Planning to, at least.</p>
