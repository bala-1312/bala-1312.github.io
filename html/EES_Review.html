        <h2 style="color: #c66;"> A Commentary on EES by Pigliucci <span class="date">2025 · 10</span></h2>
          <p>Pigliucci opens his discussion of the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis (EES) by leaning on Thomas Kuhn’s idea of paradigm shifts. (I too once attempted Kuhn’s Structure of Scientific Revolutions as a freshman; emphasis on attempted.) Paradigms, Kuhn argued, define the way science is done until anomalies build up that force a revolutionary change, like, Ptolemaic to Copernican astronomy, and the one from Newtonian to relativistic physics. Pigliucci borrows this language to suggest that evolutionary theory may be due for an update. So, naturally I was curious to see about this EES.  </p>
          <p>He frames the history of biology as a series of shifts: from Darwin’s theory of form (that complex structures like the vertebrate eye are “for” something), to the gene-centered Modern Synthesis, and now, perhaps, to something broader ( he wants another theory of form), one that incorporates development, ecology, and the findings of the post-genomic era.<br>He names,</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Phenotypic plasticity (organisms responding flexibly to their environment; thus becoming heritable).</li>
            <li>Epigenetic inheritance (heritable changes beyond DNA sequence; like methylation).</li>
            <li>Developmental bias and evo-devo(the role of developmental biology in shaping variation).</li>
            <li>Evolutionary capacitance and robustness (how systems can store or release hidden variation).<br>as potential extensions.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>And yet, here’s the tension: Pigliucci calls for a paradigm shift without ever fully delivering one. I definitely expected more from a man who wrote this in the review - &quot;Well, perhaps, but some of us are not ready for retirement just yet.&quot;<br>He floats the idea that the Modern Synthesis is incomplete, but also concedes that it may just need to be extended rather than replaced. In other words, he wants Kuhn’s scientific revolution while also playing safe with Popper’s steady incrementalism. They are opposite poles, somebody has to pick a side.</p>
          <p>If the current framework is just fine with little bit of updates and it doesn&#39;t face any anomalies yet; then there is no need for bringing kuhn&#39;s paradigm shift.</p>
          <p>I enjoyed the historical context, the occasional wry humor and his extended synthesis. But that&#39;s what left me feeling a bit betrayed, that this is actually about extension rather than replacement. But it was a great read!</p>
